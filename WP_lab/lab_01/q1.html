        <h1>A Soldier - Robert Frost</h1>

            He is that fallen lance that lies as <b>hurled</b>,<br>
            That lies unlifted now, come dew, come <b>rust</b>,<br>
            But still lies pointed as it plowed the <b>dust</b>.<br>
            If we who sight along it round the <b>world</b>,<br>
            See nothing worthy to have been its <b>mark</b>,<br>
            It is because like men we look too <b>near</b>,<br>
            Forgetting that as fitted to the <b>sphere</b>,<br>
            Our missiles always make too short an <b>arc</b>.<br>
            They fall, they rip the grass, they <b>intersect</b><br>
            The curve of earth, and striking, break their <b>own</b>;<br>
            They make us cringe for metal-point on <b>stone</b>.<br>
            But this we know, the obstacle that <b>checked</b><br>
            And tripped the body, shot the spirit <b>on</b><br>
            Further than target ever showed or <b>shone</b>.
